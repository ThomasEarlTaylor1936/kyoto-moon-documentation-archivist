# DA Provenance Entry — Example (v0.1)

**Date:** 2025-11-08  
**Project:** Documentation Archivist (Kyoto Moon Edition)

## Intent
Prevent DA from being misread as a note-taking or journaling tool.

## Context
README explained the purpose but did not clearly distinguish DA from PKM systems.

## Action
Added a “What DA Is / Isn’t” section and clarified the concept of searchable memory.

## Decision
Standardize the minimal provenance schema:
Intent → Context → Action → Decision → Evidence → Next

## Evidence
Commit: <commit SHA>
Files updated: `README.md`

## Next
Add the DA Session Template so users have a starting point.

# Search Anchors:
Intent: onboarding clarity
Decision: adopt provenance schema
Evidence: commit <sha>
