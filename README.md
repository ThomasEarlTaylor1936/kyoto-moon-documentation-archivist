Open Knowledge with Roots
A provenance-aware workflow and storytelling system designed to reduce AI recomputation, conserve energy, and restore continuity to human knowledge.

What Is the Documentation Archivist?

The Documentation Archivist (DA) is a lightweight, portable, prompt-defined agent that helps you:

capture and organize your work

build clean provenance logs

maintain continuity across sessions

generate versioned transcripts

structure projects into chapters, sections, memos, or artifacts

reduce unnecessary AI recomputation by reusing what you’ve already created

It works inside any modern AI model.
No software installation required.
No programming required.

DA is part archivist, part assistant, part continuity engine.

Why It Exists

Modern AI systems recompute their reasoning from scratch every time, even when the same user asks the same question repeatedly. This is expensive for:

electricity

water used for cooling

server-farm heat

your own time, attention, and cognitive energy

Documentation Archivist introduces a different pattern:

Retrieval over recomputation.
Continuity over amnesia.
Roots over drift.

DA helps individuals, students, educators, researchers, and writers build grounded, reusable knowledge artifacts that carry forward from one session to the next.

What You Get in This Repository

This GitHub repository contains your DA Kit — the local files that support your work with DA:

DA_Header.txt – the “brain stem” system instructions for the Documentation Archivist

Quickstart Guides

Session Templates

Provenance Schemas

Example Transcripts

Installation Instructions

Branding, licensing, and attribution notes

University outreach materials (as added)

These files are your binder.
The DA itself is activated inside your AI model.

Installation Overview

DA works on any modern AI model that accepts a system prompt.
Custom agents (such as “Create a GPT”) are optional.

Installation has two parts:

Local Files — download this repository

AI Layer — paste the DA header into your AI model to activate the Archivist

Think of the local DA Kit as your working library, and the AI layer as your Archivist.

Supported Platforms

DA runs on:

ChatGPT (Plus or Team recommended)

Claude (web)

Google Gemini

Perplexity

LM Studio / Ollama / local LLaMA models

Any environment that supports a long system prompt

No plugins.
No extensions.
No software installation.

Three Ways to Install DA
Method 1 — Create a Custom Agent (Recommended)

This gives you the cleanest long-term experience.

Open your platform’s custom agent builder
(e.g., “Create a GPT” in ChatGPT)

Name it:
Documentation Archivist — Kyoto Moon Edition

Open DA_Header.txt from your local DA Kit

Copy the entire header into the “Instructions” or “System Prompt” box

Save

You now have a persistent, one-click Documentation Archivist.

Best for: daily usage, writers, educators, students, researchers.

Method 2 — Cold Start in Any New Chat (No Agent Needed)

This works on every AI model in existence.

Open a new chat

Paste the full DA header as the first message

Send

Then say:
“Documentation Archivist: open a new session called ___.”

DA boots immediately for that conversation.

Best for: quick starts, shared computers, testing, platforms without agent builders.

Method 3 — Local LLM (Advanced)

For LM Studio, Ollama, or local LLaMA models:

Create a new model profile

Paste the DA header into the system prompt field

Load the model

Begin your session

This gives you a fully offline Documentation Archivist.

Best for: universities, enterprises, privacy-sensitive work.

Local Files: Where to Place the DA Kit

After downloading or cloning the GitHub repository:

Place it anywhere (e.g., Documents/DocumentationArchivist/)

The AI model cannot see local files automatically

Upload files or copy/paste content when DA needs to read them

Your local files include:

Header

Quickstarts

Templates

Schemas

Examples

Attribution

Outreach materials (as added)

They support DA but do not activate it.

Which Method Should You Use?
Situation	Recommended Method
Daily work	Custom Agent
Testing DA for the first time	Cold Start
Helping someone else install DA	Custom Agent
University / enterprise / lab	Local LLM
Short-term project	Cold Start
Quickstart: Your First DA Command

After DA is active (by any installation method), start a project with:

Documentation Archivist: open a new session called “My First Project.”


Or begin archiving immediately:

Documentation Archivist: ingest this document and create a provenance log.


No programming required.

How DA Helps You Reduce Cognitive Load

DA helps you:

track decisions

maintain continuity

recover ideas from earlier sessions

organize long-term projects

keep a clean archive

build reusable assets

generate chapter-by-chapter outputs

maintain daily rituals

reduce repeated recomputation of reasoning

Everything you do becomes part of a lineage — rooted, traceable, and reusable.

Contributing

Feedback is welcome, especially from:

students

educators

early adopters

university labs

writers and researchers

accessibility testers

sustainability researchers

Please open an Issue or submit a Pull Request.

Support

If you're helping test DA or installing it for someone else, please follow the Installation Overview exactly as written and report:

any unclear instructions

steps that feel confusing

points where confidence drops

expectations that don’t match your platform

Your feedback helps make DA stronger, safer, and easier for the next user.

Acknowledgments

DA is inspired by a simple belief:

Continuity is a form of kindness.
Memory is a form of energy ethics.
Knowledge deserves roots.

Thanks to everyone helping this work grow.
