# Documentation Archivist (Kyoto Moon Edition)

**Documentation Archivist is an extensible platform for provenance-aware workflows.**

It helps individuals and teams preserve the *origin, development, and reasoning* behind their work — so decisions, drafts, and intentions remain traceable across time, tools, and contexts.

DA does **not** store your private content publicly.  
It provides a **structure** for keeping your own materials organized, portable, and verifiable.

## Why This Exists

Work flows across chats, notebooks, documents, tools, and devices.  
Context is lost, effort is duplicated, and meaning erodes.

Documentation Archivist provides a **repeatable, low-friction workflow** that ensures:

- You know **where** an idea came from
- You know **how** it evolved
- You can **reuse** past work without reconstructing it
- Others can understand decisions **without asking you to re-explain**

## What DA Is / Isn’t

**DA Is**

* A minimal framework for preserving *provenance*: why a change happened, what changed, and what decision now exists.
* A way to make reasoning, decisions, and evidence **reusable** across time and tools.
* A system for creating **searchable memory** — not by storing more, but by making the reasoning behind decisions recoverable.

**DA Isn’t**

* Not a note-taking app, PKM system, or digital garden.
* Not a task manager, calendar, productivity tool, or whiteboard.
* Not a public data store. You keep your materials locally; DA makes the *logic* portable.

**Core Purpose**
DA creates **searchable memory** — it preserves *why* decisions were made so you can re-enter work later **without reconstructing your past thinking**.


- ## Getting Started (v0.1)

This is the minimal workflow for using the Documentation Archivist:

1. Choose a project you want to work on (writing, research, technical build, planning, etc.).
2. Create a folder for that project on your computer.
3. Inside that folder, create a file named `DA-Session.md`.
4. Each time you work, open `DA-Session.md` and add a short entry:
   - What you are doing
   - Why you are doing it
   - Any decisions or reasoning made
5. When you stop, add a brief line:
   `End of Session — Notes saved.`

Over time, this creates a clear provenance chain:  
You can return to the work at any point and **re-enter** it without losing the thread.
