# Documentation Archivist (Kyoto Moon Edition)

**Documentation Archivist is an extensible platform for provenance-aware workflows.**

It helps individuals and teams preserve the *origin, development, and reasoning* behind their work — so decisions, drafts, and intentions remain traceable across time, tools, and contexts.

DA does **not** store your private content publicly.  
It provides a **structure** for keeping your own materials organized, portable, and verifiable.

## Why This Exists

Work flows across chats, notebooks, documents, tools, and devices.  
Context is lost, effort is duplicated, and meaning erodes.

Documentation Archivist provides a **repeatable, low-friction workflow** that ensures:

- You know **where** an idea came from
- You know **how** it evolved
- You can **reuse** past work without reconstructing it
- Others can understand decisions **without asking you to re-explain**
